DESCRIPTION                          *semicolon* *smart-semicolon*

This |plugin| provides an |insert-mode| |mapping| to intelligently place
semicolons within the current line. This is useful for C-like languages where
a semicolon marks the end of a line and is seldomly found somewhere else.

Upon pressing `;` in insert-mode, if every one of the following conditions is
met, the semicolon is placed at the end of the current line. Otherwise, it is
placed under the cursor as usual:

* The current line ends with an alpha-numerical ASCII character, one of the
  following characters: `_)]'"`, `--`, or `++`
* The current line does not start with `for (`, ignoring |whitespace|
* The next line is not further indented as the current one or is empty
* The next line does not end with `{`, ignoring whitespace
* The cursor is not positioned past the end of the current line
* The cursor and the end of the current line are outside a |highlight-group|
  whose name contains the string `comment`

If the semicolon is placed at the end of the line, trailing |whitespace| is
removed.


VARIABLES                          *smart-semicolon-variables*

*g:smart_semicolon_filetypes* (default `['c', 'cpp', 'cs', 'cuda', 'hlsl', 'glsl', 'css']`)

A |list| containing every |filetype| for which to create a mapping. Assign
`['*']` to create one for every filetype.
